## 🧠 1. IDEATION PHASE

This section includes the foundation of the project — identifying the problem and generating initial ideas.

- **1.1 Problem Statement**  
  Describes the core issue in the current airline management system and defines the scope of the solution.

- **1.2 Empathy Map Canvas**  
  Captures the needs, behaviors, and goals of users (passengers, airline staff, etc.) through an empathy-based approach.

- **1.3 Brainstorming**  
  Contains mind maps and raw ideas that led to the design of the final solution.
