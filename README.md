## 🛠️ Functionalities

### 🎯 1. Data Modeling
- Created 4 Custom Objects:
  - **Passenger**
  - **Booking**
  - **Flight**
  - **Crew**
- Configured custom fields:
  - Text, Number, Date, Picklists
  - Lookup relationships between objects (e.g., Booking linked to Flight and Passenger)

### 🎯 2. User Access Control
- **Custom Profiles:**
  - General Admin
  - Management Admin
  - Senior Admin
  - Crew Member
- **Roles Hierarchy:**
  - CEO
    - Senior Admin
      - General Admin
      - Management Admin
        - Crew Members

### 🎯 3. Apex Validation
- **Apex Class:**
  - `PhnValid_PassengerObj` to ensure phone number is mandatory.
- **Apex Trigger:**
  - `PhnValidTrigger` to invoke validation before insert.
- **Apex Test Class:**
  - `PhnValid_TestClass` for unit test coverage.

### 🎯 4. Automation with Flows
- **Screen Flow:**
  - Guided booking creation.
- **Create Element:**
  - Automatically saves booking records.
- **Success Screen:**
  - Displays confirmation details dynamically.

### 🎯 5. Reports & Dashboards
- **Reports:**
  - Bookings with Flight Details
  - Bookings with Passenger Names
  - Crew with Flight
- **Dashboards:**
  - Visual summary of bookings and crew assignments.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **User Management:**
   - Admins create users and assign them profiles and roles.
   - Each user’s access is controlled via profiles.

2. **Creating Records:**
   - Users can create Passenger, Flight, Booking, and Crew records via tabs.
   - Booking creation is streamlined with Screen Flow.

3. **Validation Logic:**
   - Apex Trigger ensures Passenger Phone Number is not empty.
   - If the phone number is missing, an error prevents saving.

4. **Viewing & Managing Data:**
   - Users can view, edit, or delete records according to their profile permissions.
   - Reports give aggregated insights into bookings, passengers, and flights.

5. **Dashboards:**
   - Visual components (e.g., charts and graphs) provide a quick overview of operational data.
